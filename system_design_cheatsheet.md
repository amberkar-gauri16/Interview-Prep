### üß± Load Balancing

Load balancing distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure reliability and performance.

| Tool/Tech       | Use Case               | Pros                             | Cons                        | When to Use                                           |
| --------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| NGINX / HAProxy | HTTP Load Balancer     | Simple, widely used, easy config | Limited app-layer awareness | When you need a quick reverse proxy or L7/L4 balancer |
| AWS ALB / ELB   | Managed Load Balancing | Scalable, integrated with AWS    | Cloud lock-in, cost         | AWS-hosted services or auto-scaling architectures     |
| Envoy           | Service mesh + LB      | Advanced routing, observability  | Steeper learning curve      | Use with microservices or gRPC                        |

**Important Notes:** Load balancers can be Layer 4 (TCP) or Layer 7 (HTTP). For advanced traffic routing, canary deployments, or retries, Envoy is often preferred.

### üß© API Gateways

API gateways sit between clients and services, handling routing, security, and monitoring.

| Tool/Tech        | Use Case                  | Pros                                           | Cons                        | When to Use                                             |
| ---------------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| AWS API Gateway  | Managed API Gateway       | Scales easily, integrates with AWS, throttling | Cost at high volume         | Serverless or AWS-native APIs                           |
| Kong / Tyk       | Open-source API Gateway   | Extensible plugins, authentication             | Requires setup, ops effort  | Full control over routing, rate limits, security       |
| Apigee (Google)  | Enterprise API Management | Strong analytics, policy enforcement           | Expensive, overkill for SMB | Enterprises needing deep control over public APIs      |

**Important Notes:** API gateways are key in microservices architectures for enforcing rate limits, authentication, logging, and routing to versioned services. They often work alongside service meshes for east-west traffic control.

### üì° REST APIs

REST APIs are a standard way to expose resources over HTTP using stateless, uniform interfaces.

| Feature           | Description                                                 |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Statelessness     | Each request contains all context, no server-side sessions |
| Uniform Interface | Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE)        |
| Resource-Based    | URLs represent resources; responses are typically in JSON  |
| Cacheable         | Responses can be cached with proper headers                |

**Important Notes:** REST APIs are ideal for web and mobile apps, are widely supported, and work well with API gateways. For real-time or streaming use cases, consider alternatives like gRPC or WebSockets.
